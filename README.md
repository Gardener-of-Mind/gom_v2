*Note: an R21 is an NIH (U.S.A. National Institute of Health) 
exploratory/developmental grant mechanism. Obtaining this grant would allow us 
longer-term funding to develop the same platform together and think about how it can 
be scaled to not only Indian university students but also other locations and 
populations.*

**Aims:**  

(1) To develop a platform that can be used to develop and evaluate technology-
based programs for mental health prevention and treatment.  

(2) To determine the feasibility of using personal program experience and data 
analytics to achieve better engagement and outcomes in defined populations 
(e.g., universities)  

  
**Hypotheses:**  
Data analytic-driven Individualized Program Development 
for improving Engagement and Aims/Outcomes Methodology (IDEA) will 
significantly improve user engagement and mental health outcomes 

Meaning:  
Using individual program usage and acceptability/likeability data 
along with mental health outcome data to inform program development will 
significantly improve overall user engagement and ultimately mental health 
outcomes


**Introduction:**  

1. Anxiety disorders and depression are common and disabling problems among
college students

2. While many online interventions are available, they reach a very small percentage 
when disseminated in a defined university population, and have very low engagement rates. Furthermore,the process of developing interventions is glacial: programs are “fixed”, evaluated in long-term controlled studies, and 
calculated effect sizes (i.e., how much better off those who use the intervention 
are compared to those who don’t use it) are often unable to be replicated. 

3.  Modern intervention programs should be developed with: 

  a. Attention to user interface and experience 

  b. Iterative program developed based on user needs, interests, and
  acceptability/likeability, across components of the program, in addition to 
  ultimate mental health outcomes gathered via ecological momentary assessment 
  (EMA – this just means surveys that are conducted “in the moment”)  

  c. This process is related but different from adaptive or sequential designs (must 
  explain how it is different)

  4.   To achieve this goal (3), it is important to: 

    a. Have a software program designed for immediate, accessible data collection

    b. Have a flexible authoring system 

    c. Have an intervention program authoring team committed to the on-going 
    content adaptation in sequence with program adaptation
